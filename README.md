This repository refers to the paper [insert name and journal] 

Script:
Published_Script refers to the R script used for this study.
The script is written in R (R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31 ucrt)).
R script was written for RStudio but not tested in other environment.

Data:
Subset_dataset refers to a subset of the original processed dataset used in the study for the modelling.
The data  provided for this script is only a subset (n = 15) of the original dataset (N = 159), intended for demonstration purposes.

Data availability:
As of today (8th of May 2024) it is planned that the raw data for the dataset will be published openly-accessible after the i4s project ended.
As of today (8th of May 2024), I am not allowed to publish the whole dataset but I am willing to share the full dataset (N = 159) for reproducibility purposes.
However, further usage of the dataset may be restricted.

Notes:
Performance is very sensitive to the number of training samples.
Hence, the results with this subset are not comparable in any way to the results provided in our paper. 

Further code:
I did not share the code to generate all the figures due to messy documentation.
However, if you are interested please contact me (Jonas.Schmidinger@uni-osnabrueck.de) and I will share it.
