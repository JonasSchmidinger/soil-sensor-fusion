This repository refers to the paper "Which and how many soil sensors are ideal to predict key soil properties: A case study with seven sensors" published in Geoderma

# Script:
Published_Script refers to the R script used for this study, responding to the workflow in Fig. 2 of the paper.
The script is written in R (R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31 ucrt)).
R script was written for RStudio but not tested in other environment.

# Data:
Joint_Table_15_rds refers to a subset of the original processed dataset used in the study for the modelling.
Joint_Table_15_rds_codes.txt gives an overview about the structure and codes of the dataset.
The data  provided for this script is only a subset (n = 15) of the original dataset (N = 159), intended for demonstration purposes.


# Data availability:
As of today (8th of May 2024) it is planned that the raw data for the dataset will be published openly-accessible after the i4s project ended.
As of today (8th of May 2024), I am not allowed to publish the whole dataset but I am willing to share the full dataset (N = 159) for reproducibility purposes.
However, further usage of the dataset may be restricted.

# Notes:
Performance is very sensitive to the number of training samples.
Hence, the results with this subset are not comparable in any way to the results provided in our paper. 

If you have any other questions please contact me (Jonas.Schmidinger@uni-osnabrueck.de).
